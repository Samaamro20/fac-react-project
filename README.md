# React Project!

- Build an interactive game that uses data from an API

Features you can include:

* Let you submit a username
* Query the [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) (or any other [fun one](https://www.potterapi.com/) you like
* Populate a UI with the user details
* Have some form of persistent state and interactivity, e.g.
  * A hunger bar that decreases over time and is topped up when you feed them stars
  * A button to add more users to your collection
* Have integration tests! (and units tests if they're relevant)

Try to:

* Write modular code: one component per file
* Separate your container logic from presentational components

### Stretch goals

* Save your state to localstorage so you can leave the page and come back later
* Have a button to add more copies of the game

### Examples

Previous facsters have created noughts and crosses, card games, tamagotchis, github wars. Be creative!
