# Tamagotchi Project!

The goal is to build a Github profile Tamagotchi.

It should:

- Let you submit a username
- Query the Github API for that user
- Populate a UI with the user details
- Have some form of persistent state and interactivity, e.g.
  - A hunger bar that decreases over time and is topped up when you feed them stars
  - A button to add more users to your collection

### Stretch goals

- Save your state to localstorage so you can leave the page and come back later
- Make it look pretty!
