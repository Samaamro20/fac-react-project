# Tamagotchi Project!

The goal is to build a Tamagotchi.

It should:

* Let you submit a name
* Query the [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) (or any other [fun one](https://www.potterapi.com/) you like
* Populate a UI with the user details
* Have some form of persistent state and interactivity, e.g.
  * A hunger bar that decreases over time and is topped up when you feed them stars
  * A button to add more users to your collection
* Test the important bits at least

Try to:

* Write modular code: one component per file
* Separate your container logic from presentational components

### Stretch goals

- Save your state to localstorage so you can leave the page and come back later
- Make it look like a real Tamagotchi!
